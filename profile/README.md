# 🎨 ArtOut – The Real-Time Global Street Art Map 🗺️

**ArtOut** is a living, collaborative archive of street art — captured *in the moment*, geotagged instantly, and discoverable by anyone, anywhere.

Our mission is to **preserve the ephemeral**, celebrate creativity in public spaces, and build the most comprehensive visual map of street art on Earth.

## 🌍 About the Platform

At **ArtOut**, every user becomes a curator. Snap a photo, and it’s:

* ✅ Geotagged with exact **location** (city, street, country)
* ✅ Added to the **global street art map**
* ✅ Preserved in a public **visual archive**

🖼️ **No uploads. No accounts. No friction.** Just capture — and contribute.

---

## 🖌️ Key Features

### For Explorers & Fans

* 🌎 **Browse art** by country, city, suburb, or street
* 🔍 **Discover hidden gems** from alleyways to rooftops
* 🕰️ **View archived art** that may no longer exist in real life

### For Artists & Citizens

* 📸 **Snap and tag** street art with zero setup
* 🔗 **Share instantly** — no account required
* 🧠 **Add metadata** (author, style, links) if registered

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Capture** – Use your camera to snap street art in real-time
2. **Geotag** – ArtOut auto-tags with precise location data
3. **Preserve** – Each snap becomes part of our permanent archive
4. **Discover** – Browse the global map or drill into a specific street

🙌 **Anonymous by default.** No login needed. Just art, as it happens.

## 🌈 Why It Matters

Street art is **fragile**. It’s painted over, destroyed, or lost in time.

**ArtOut** exists to:

* ✅ Archive **urban culture** before it vanishes
* ✅ Build a **global public gallery**
* ✅ Celebrate the artists of the streets, from amateurs to legends
